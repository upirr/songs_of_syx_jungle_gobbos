Very good. That farm will serve us well. You can read more about how farms work in the encyclopedia. To compliment the farm, let's build a hunter this time. Don't make it too big, as your construction materials are limited.

Oh no! You're out of building materials. I've spawned some by your throne, but next time, you'll have to create some for yourself, by harvesting trees and boulders.

Almost everything in this game requires maintenance in the form of labour and resources. Without it structures will decay and loose their efficiency. That's why it's time to build a janitor!

IMMIGRATION: {

"
Your little villagers are now enjoying their stay to a degree that they recommend it to friends. Immigration will spawn when your happiness is over a certain degree. You can have a look at what factors that make up your happiness by clicking the citizen button top-right. It will give you an idea of how to progress later on. 
To accept the new immigrants, you can do so in the citizen panel -> select species -> population, or by double clicking the species in the panel to the right. Be careful not to accept too many at once, as they will eat all our food!

Excellent. Free workers will store resources laying about, but it's far better to allocate a deliveryman to do this work. Click the new warehouse and slide the worker slider to max.

Now you've got the basics set up for a self sustaining village. To proceed I recommend reading the encyclopedia. Don't forget to always allocate 30%-50% of your workforce towards food production and you should be relatively fine.
