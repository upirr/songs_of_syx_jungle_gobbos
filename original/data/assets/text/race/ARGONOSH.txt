DESC_LONG:
"During the first war of the gods, Aminion - the evil one, created the great queen of the Argonosh - Shmalor, to do his bidding. She, and her spawn served as shock troops in his armies. These creatures were as tall and wide as a longhouse and devastating to the Astari alliance. After Aminion's imprisonment and the slaying of Shmalor, what remained of the great Argonosh retreated back into their burrows. Their blood watered down over generations, and the Argonosh living today are nothing like those of old. They are however a formidable force on the battlefield, should you manage to attract them to your cause.
