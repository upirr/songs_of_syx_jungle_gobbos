Fisheries is an agricultural building specializing in gathering fish. 
%r%%r%
In order for your workers to gather the fish, the room needs to be placed mostly in water. This water can be either a river, sea or even a man made canal if it is large enough. The fish can only be caught in shallow water (bright blue in the water). You can see if there are fish available in the water by an up arrow icon while trying to place the fishery. The density of the fish is also reflected in the color of the arrow, with green being higher, yellow being moderate and red being lower.
%r%%r%
The minimum size of the fishery is the space required for the storage, and 1 tile on a fish node. This however is hugely inefficient. The maximum size is 2025 (45x45) which can take up to 120 worker. However, you will need to place storage and auxiliary items on land in order for the building to operate. These cannot be placed in water.
%r%%r%
Fisheries provide a constant stream of food income rather than bursts such as with farms. These can yield through the entire year. Ways to improve the yield of fisheries and factors that can affect yield are:
%r%%r%
Water Amount - This is found on the map when you first select a place to put your city. You can read the amount of water on the tool tip. This will mainly affect wither you are able to place effective canal fish farms or not. Also, the more of your farm is on water, the more workers are able to fish.
%r%%r%
Tools - As your workers get tools, they will be able to produce more yield.
%r%%r%
Technology - After you have build a library and obtained some research points, you may spend points in the technology tree to improve the yield of your fisheries.
%r%%r%
Skill - Your workers will gain experience as they fish, and over time they will become more effective at gathering fish.

		TEXT: "
Hunters are formidable food producers, especially if wild game is plentiful. Hunter rooms have a radius that they work in, covering a quarter of the map give or take. Hunters will seek out animals in this radius, kill them and bring them back for slaughter.
Sometimes hunters will just spook the prey and come back empty-handed. Once a kill is done, hunters will drag the carcass back to the room for butchering. This will produce resources, depending on animal species. It also has a small chance of producing livestock{ResourcesLivestock}, that can be used to populate Pastures{RoomsPastures}.

		NAME: "Decorations",
		TEXT: "
Decorations comes in many shapes and sizes. Each emits a certain environmental value in its visible range. Different species like different such values. A monument doesn't require workers to run, but does require regular maintenance.
When subjects are within range of a decoration, their environmental{Environment} impression will go up. It will slowly decline in its absence. Place decorations where subject traffic is dense for optimal effect.

		NAME: "Woodcutter",
		TEXT: "
Woodcutters must be mainly placed on trees in order to function. The amount of trees determine the amount of workers that can be employed and output. Efficiency can be boosted by Auxiliary items and the usage of tools. a storage must also be placed where the wood{ResourcesWood} will end up.

		TEXT: "
An extraction room bust be partially placed on its corresponding deposit. Not only the quantity, but also the quality of the deposits is taken into consideration when determining the output of the extractor.
The quality is visually represented by appearing denser. One can click and hold the right mouse button over a deposit to get an exact figure. 
Efficiency can be boosted by Auxiliary items and the usage of tools. a storage must also be placed where the extracted resource will end up.

		NAME: "Farms",
		TEXT: "
Farms are where subjects turn soil, water, sunlight and time into crops. The crops you can grow is  Grain, Vegetables, Fruit, Mushrooms and Cotton. The work process is governed by the four seasons which are:
%r%%r%
Spring - Clearing Weeds %r%
Summer - Tending to the crops %r%
Autumn - Harvesting %r%
Winter - Tilling
%r%%r%
Farms are best placed on ground with high fertility, which you can see soil fertility rates by holding the right mouse button on the area of the map you wish to build. The exception is Mushrooms, where they have higher fertility rates based on low or no fertility on the soil. 
%r%%r%
Farms require a minimum size of 64 Square Tiles (8x8) which requires 1 worker, and can go to a maximum of 2,025 Square Tiles (45x45) which requires 31 workers.
%r%%r%
Farms will yield a certain amount of resources per worker each day. This can be found on the info panel at the top when you select the farm. When building the farm, it has a one time cost of the resource you wish to produce, from there it will yield every year with no additional resource input.
%r%%r%
As you build larger farms, the worker allocation is defaulted to the maximum workers rounded down to the nearest whole number. You may choose to reduce the number of workers, however your output will decrease according to the yield number referenced in the above statement. However, putting more workers into the farm than it requires, will not yield additional output.
%r%%r%
A farms yield may further be increased by the following factors:
%r%%r%
Irrigation - Requires canals or water immediately adjacent to the farm on either of the four sides, the more water that touches the farm, the higher the irrigation percentage, up to a max of 100%.
%r%
Skill - The experience of the farmers may increase yield, this is gained by having those workers employed as farmers. 
%r%
Tools - Tools increase the yield of workers who are on possession of them.
%r%
Technology - Gained by researching technology in the library, you may choose to select what type of crops receive technology upgrades.
%r%%r%
Workers from farms also bring their farmed products to nearby storehouses. Having a storehouse too far away may result in crops being left on the field which rots and disappears.

		NAME: "Pastures",
		TEXT: "
Pastures are a building in the agricultural section which specializes livestock.
%r%%r%
Animals are gained from Livestock, can be obtained either by trade or by a hunter. For the livestock to be placed in the pasture, it must first go to a storage room where a worker will need to bring the livestock to the pasture. It is advisable to have a nearby storage room to your pastures for this very reason. Pastures also produce livestock by themselves as a slow rate, so it is only important to hunt or trade for that initial start.
%r%%r%
Pasture Types are as follows:
%r%%r%
Auroch -They produce meat and leather, these are more easily found in colder environments.%r%
Onx -They produce meat and cotton, these can be bred pretty well anywhere.%r%
Entelodant -They produce meat only, these can be bred pretty well anywhere.%r%
Globdien - They produce meat and eggs, these are found mainly in swampy areas.%r%
%r%%r%
In emergencies, the animals can be instantly slaughtered for resources. Be sure to have sufficient workers and storage capacity to quickly gather and store these items, as they will rot and disappear if left un-gathered for too long.
%r%%r%
Pastures can go to a minimum of 49 tiles (7x7), up to a maximum of 2,025 tiles (45x45). At minimum, it requires 1 worker, with a maximum worker count of about 30 depending on fertility rates.
%r%%r%
Factors that affect yield are:
%r%%r%
Fertility - This affects how many animals can be placed in the area. Higher fertility means a more dense pasture, while low fertility will mean a scarce pasture.
%r%
Tools - workers will be able to increase yield based on the tools they posses.
%r%
Skill - As workers collect experience, they will be able to provide higher yields.
%r%
Size - Larger pastures are more effective than smaller pastures as the death rate of the animals dictates the yield. The more animals that are born, the more animals that will die of age.
%r%
Pastures yield the lowest amount of food based on the land used, however the materials gained aside from food can be extremely valuable and in some cases drive your trade income. Pastures also require the least amount of workers to operate for the space taken.
%r%%r%
Pastures yield food and materials in increments throughout the year.  The yield is based on the death rate of the animals inside of the pasture. The more dense a pasture is, the more deaths there will be in each year, which directly effects yield.

		TEXT: "
Refiners are big and noisy raw processing rooms that turn raw materials into other resources. 
The produce a lot of noise{EnvironmentNoise}, and a lot of manpower to run. 
Part of the workforce will fetch raw materials, while the rest will work the machines. Make sure the raw materials are close to the room, as items will be carried one at a time, and production will slow significantly if the workers have to travel vast distances. 
Refiners have internal storage for its output next to each work station. Once these are full, no more work can be done, and the workers will wait until 
the produce has been emptied by a Warehouse{RoomsWarehouse} Deliveryman.
%r%%r%
Refiners need Auxiliary items to function well and are boosted significantly by tool usage.

Workshop are similar to Refiners{RoomRefiners}, but the emphasize more on craftsmanship, and being a craftsman is highly esteemed by most species. 
Most require some form of input that must be fetched. Keep it close by. And make sure the room reaches 100% efficiency by placing Auxiliary items.
When the rooms internal storage is full, it must be emptied by a Warehouse{RoomsWarehouse} Deliveryman.
